# bd-codealong-7-1-sorting-algorithms-starter

This repository is for Code-Along BD 7.2. 
You are encouraged to explore and write your own implementation for a couple of sorting algorithms as this is a common request during a whiteboard portion of a technical interview. 
SelectionSort and InsertionSort are the easiest, and BubbleSort is often requested specifically.
